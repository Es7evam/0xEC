# Multiclycle Mips CPU (MMCPU)

  MMPCU is a very simple multicycle MIPS CPU simulator designed as programming exercise for classes on Computer Organizations. Students are required to complete the implementation with their own code.

  MMCPU is based on "CPU MIPS Multiciclo"  by [Prof. Paulo Sergio Lopes de
  Souza](http://conteudo.icmc.usp.br/pessoas/pssouza/) of [ICMC - University of Sao Paulo](http://icmc.usp.br/).  The original code by Dr. Souza
  has been largely rewritten to accomodate changes in the project structure,
  Make build system, localization and a other changes.

## Instructions
  Students are required to complete the implementation of the simulator by
  editing the file code.c.

  In order to build the software:
### Prerequisites
```
unix based operating system
make
gcc compiler
```
### Build the software
In case you have the prerequesites, do the following at your chosen terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/OrgComp-2017/0xEC
cd 0xEC
make
```
## Running the software
Just use
```
./cpu
```

## Warning

  This code is in alpha stage and it may be updated frequently
  during this period. If so happens, you may need to update your project.
  To that end, patches will be released which you can safely apply
  to your own code (no API changes will take place in course of
  the discipline term).
